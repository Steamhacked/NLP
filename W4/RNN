Pros:

> Input of any length
> Computation for a given step requires use of information many steps back (allows to capture longer dependencies)
> Model size does not increase for longer input
> Same weights applied over every timestep, symmetrical in input processing

Cons:

> Recurrent computation is slow
> Difficult to access information many steps back (in practice)
