LSTM - LongShortTermMemory,

What does it solve and how?

Vanishing Gradient, by the means of: Π(j=k+1, t) δh_j/δh_j-1 = Π(j=k+1, t) σ'W_h

σ -> Sigmoid "Gate" ε [0,1] , 0 -> pass no information, 1 -> pass all the information

States:
> Hidden State -> 
> Cell State -> stores long-term information (memory, modified via gates)

Gates:
> Forget Gate -> based on the past hidden states and current input, selects information from past cell to forget (filter)
  > f_t = σ(W_f*[h_t-1, x_t] + b_f)
  > C_t = f_t*C_t
> Input Gate -> based on the past hidden states and current input, selects information from temporary cell state to memorize (write)
  > i_t = σ(W_i*[h_t-1, x_t] +b_f)
  > C_t = tanh(W_c*[h_t-1, x_t] + b_C)
> Output Gate -> based on the past hidden states and current input, selects information from the current cell state as current hidden state
  > o_t = σ(W_o*[h_t-1, x_t] + b_o)
  > h_t = o_t * tanh(C_t)
